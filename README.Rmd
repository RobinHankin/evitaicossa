An *algebra* is a vector space in which the vectors may be multiplied.
The `evitaicossa` package gives some R-centric functionality to deal
with _antiassociative_ algebras in which the usual associativity
relation
$\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{v}\mathbf{w})=(\mathbf{u}\mathbf{v})\mathbf{w}$ is
replaced by the relation
$\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{v}\mathbf{w})=-(\mathbf{u}\mathbf{v})\mathbf{w}$.


In an R session, you can install the released version of `evitaicossa`
from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r, message=FALSE}
# install.packages("evitaicossa")  # uncomment to install the package
library("evitaicossa")             # loads the package 
```

The package includes a single S4 class `aaa` [for
"**a**nti**a**ssociative **a**lgebra"] and a range of functions to
create objects of this class.


```{r}
x <- as.aaa("x")
y <- as.aaa("y")
x
y
```
