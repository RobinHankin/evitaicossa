Description: Methods to deal with the free antiassociative algebra
      over the reals with an arbitrary number of indeterminates.
      Antiassociativity means that (xy)z = -x(yz).  Antiassociative
      algebras are nilpotent with nilindex four and this drives the
      design and philosophy of the package.  Methods are defined to
      create and manipulate arbitrary elements of the antiassociative
      algebra, and to extract and replace coefficients.  A vignette is
      provided.
